📌 Introduction
This repository contains a Parking Slot Detection system, which is an essential component of smart parking solutions. The project likely leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify and mark available parking spaces in real-time or from images/videos.

🔍 Key Features
✔ Automated Parking Detection – Identifies vacant and occupied parking slots.
✔ Computer Vision-Based – Likely uses OpenCV, YOLO, or other deep learning models.
✔ Real-Time Processing – Can be integrated with live camera feeds for dynamic parking management.
✔ Dataset & Training – May include labeled datasets for model training.
✔ Easy Deployment – Well-structured code for seamless implementation.
